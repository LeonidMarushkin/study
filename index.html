    <div>
        <p> <b>The Emperor of Mankind</b>, often referred to by His faithful as the <b>"God-Emperor"</b>, the <b>"Master
                of
                Mankind"</b>, or simply <b>"the Emperor"</b>, and who sometimes referred to Himself as "Revelation,"
            known
            to the forces of Chaos as the False Emperor or the Corpse Emperor, is the immortal Perpetual and psyker who
            serves as the reigning monarch of the Imperium of Man, and is described by the Imperial Ecclesiarchy and the
            Imperial Cult as the father, guardian and god of Humanity.</p>
        <blockquote><i>The universe has many horrors yet to throw at us. This is not the end of our struggle. This is
                just
                the beginning of our crusade to save Humanity. Be faithful! Be strong! Be vigilant!" - Last words of the
                Emperor of Mankind before he was interred in the Golden Throne</i></blockquote>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p><i>The Chaos Gods</i> and the <i>Daemons</i> of the Warp refer to Him as <s>"the Anathema"</s> for He is the
            greatest embodiment of universal order in the galaxy today and the most potent foe of <i>Chaos</i> in
            existence.
            He was, and remains, the most powerful Human psyker to have ever been born.</p>
        <blockquote><i>“One unbreakable shield against the coming darkness, One last blade, forged in defiance of fate.
                Let
                them be my
                legacy to the galaxy I conquered, And my final gift to a species I failed.” —Arcus Daemonica, Emperor of
                Mankind.</i></blockquote>

    <div>
        <p>He has sat immobile, His body slowly crumbling, within the <u>Golden Throne of Terra</u> for over 10,000
            standard
            years. Although once a living man, His shattered, decaying body can no longer support life, and it is kept
            intact only by the cybernetic mechanisms of the <u>Golden Throne</u> and a potent mind itself sustained by
            the
            daily sacrifice of thousands of lives.</p>
        <blockquote><i>Hate! Hate! Hate! <br>
                An emotion as pure as it is deep! <br>
                Hate! Hate! Hate!<br>
                Let it flow, let it run free! —Book of the Astronomican</i></blockquote>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>The Emperor chose to sacrifice His immortal life at the end of the Horus Heresy in the service and protection
            of
            Mankind. To Humanity's countless trillions across the galaxy-spanning Imperium, He is nothing less than God.
            Through His Imperium, Humanity is united and remains one of the most powerful intelligent species in the
            Milky
            Way Galaxy as well as its most dominant in terms of both population and territory held.</p>
